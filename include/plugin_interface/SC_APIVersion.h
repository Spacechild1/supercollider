//! @file SC_APIVersion.h
//! @brief This file implements SC's plugin API versioning.
//! For more information, see the README.md

//! @brief Turn an API version tuple into a hexadecimal version code.
//! The upper byte contains the major version, the lower byte the minor version.
//! For example, 0x0401 stands for API version 4.1.
#define SC_MAKE_API_VERSION(major, minor) (((major) << 8) | ((minor)&0xFF))

//! @brief Get the major part of a hexadecimal version number.
#define SC_GET_MAJOR_VERSION(version) ((version) >> 8)

//! @brief Get the minor part of a hexadecimal version number.
#define SC_GET_MINOR_VERSION(version) ((version)&0xFF)

//! @brief The major API version.
//! @note For SC developers only!
//! SC developers must increment this in case of an ABI break. Try to avoid if possible!
//! A Server must only load plugins with the same major API version.
//!
//! @note The plugin API version has been temporarily bumped to avoid potential crashes
//! with existing plugins on the develop branch. After all plugin API changes have been
//! made for SC 3.15, the major API version should be restored to 4.
#define SC_API_VERSION_MAJOR 8

//! @brief The minor API version.
//! @note For SC developers only!
//! SC developers must increment this whenever they add new members to one or more versioned structs.
#define SC_API_VERSION_MINOR 0

//! @brief The plugin API version code.
#define SC_API_VERSION SC_MAKE_API_VERSION(SC_API_VERSION_MAJOR, SC_API_VERSION_MINOR)

//! @brief Plugins: request a specific *minimum* required API version.
//! The value is supposed to be a hexadecimal version code, see SC_MAKE_API_VERSION().
//!
//! @note Make sure to set this for all your headers and sources, ideally via the build system.
//! For example:
//! `-DSC_MIN_REQUIRED_API_VERSION=0x0402`
//! or
//! `-DSC_MIN_REQUIRED_API_VERSION=SC_MAKE_API_VERSION(4, 2)`
//!
//! Any fields that have been added up to (and including) SC_MIN_REQUIRED_API_VERSION are always
//! accessible to the plugin. Trying to access any later fields gives a compile time error.
//! A Server must only load a plugin if its exported SC_MIN_REQUIRED_API_VERSION is less than
//! or equal to the Server's own API version.
//!
//! The default value is rather conservative, but suitable for most plugins. Plugin authors
//! are advised to only set it as high as necessary so that their plugin can still be loaded
//! in older Server versions.

//! @brief Plugins: enable all API extensions.
//!
//! Normally, any fields that have been added *after* <SC_MIN_REQUIRED_API_VERSION> are not
//! accessable to the plugin. Setting SC_ENABLE_ALL_API_EXTENSIONS to 1 enables these fields.
//! However, since some of the fields might not be actually implemented yet, they must be checked
//! at runtime with the SC_API_CHECK_FIELD macro.
//!
//! Usually, plugin author should only enable this option if they want to use certain (optional)
//! fields from more recent API versions while staying compatible with older API versions.
//! In that case, they would set SC_MIN_REQUIRED_API_VERSION to the oldest API version they want
//! to support and explicitly check any fields that have been added in subsequent versions.
//!
//! Disabled by default for safety reasons.

//! @brief A macro for marking plugin API extensions.
//! @note For SC developers only!
//! All struct members added in a particular SC version must be wrapped in a SC_API_EXTENSION(X, Y)
//! clause, where X is the current major API version and Y is the *new* minor API version.
//!
//! Hypothetical example:
//! @todo Replace this with an actual example once we add the first extension.
//! @code
//! struct Unit {
//!     size_t mStructSize;
//!     World* mWorld;
//!     // etc.

//! #if SC_API_EXTENSIONS(4, 1)
//!     int32 mFoo;
//!     int32 mBar;
//! #endif
//! };
//! @endcode

//! @note Whenever the *major* API version is bumped, you can remove all SC_API_EXTENSION()
//! clauses because the fields have now become all mandatory.

//! @defgroup Versioned_structs Versioned Structs
//!
//! A 'versioned struct' is just a regular C struct whose first member (`mStructSize`)
//! contains the (implemented) struct size. This way the struct user can check at runtime
//! whether certain (optional) fields are actualy implemented.
//!
//! Currently, the following public structs are versioned:
//! - InterfaceTable
//! - World
//! - Unit
//! - Graph
//! - SndBuf
//!
//! @{

//! @brief Calculates the implemented size of a versioned struct.
//! @param structName   The name of the struct
//! @param memberName   The name of the *last* implemented member in that struct
//!
//! This macro should be used for initializing the `mStructSize` member of a versioned struct.
//! Currently, all public (versioned) structs are provided by the Server, so this is macro is never
//! used by plugins. This might change in the future once plugins also create and pass versioned
//! structs to the Server.
//!
//! @attention Do **not** use sizeof() because the actual value might change accross API versions.
//! Also, sizeof() may include padding bytes, in which case it could wrongly indicate the presence
//! of a member that actually does not exist.
//!
//! Example:
//! @code
//! struct Unit {
//!     size_t mStructSize;
//!     World* mWorld;
//!     // etc.
//!     int32 mBufLength;
//! };
//!
//! // Server:
//! unit->mStructSize = SC_API_STRUCT_SIZE(Unit, mBufLength);
//! @endcode
#if defined(__cplusplus)
#    define SC_API_STRUCT_SIZE(structName, memberName)                                                                 \
        (offsetof(structName, memberName) + sizeof(static_cast<structName*>(nullptr)->memberName))
#else
#    define SC_API_STRUCT_SIZE(StructType, memberName)                                                                 \
        (offsetof(StructType, memberName) + sizeof(((StructType*)NULL)->memberName))
#endif

//! @brief Check whether a versioned struct implements a particular field.
//! @param pointerToStruct  Pointer to a struct instance
//! @param structName       The name of the struct
//! @param memberName       The name of the member to check
//!
//! This is only necessary for optional fields, i.e. those that have been introduced after
//! SC_MIN_REQUIRED_API_VERSION and enabled with SC_ENABLE_ALL_API_EXTENSIONS.
//!
//! Hypothetical example:
//! @todo Replace this with an actual example once we add the first extension.
